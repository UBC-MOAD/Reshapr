The Reshapr package (:py:obj:`Reshapr`) is Command-line tool based on Xarray and Dask
for extraction of model variable time series from model products like
SalishSeaCast, HRDPS & CANESM2/CGCM4.


.. _ReshaprPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11%20%7C%203.12-blue?logo=python&label=Python&logoColor=gold
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.12/
    :alt: Python Version

The :py:obj:`Reshapr` package is developed and tested using `Python`_ 3.12.
The package uses some Python language features that are not available in various earlier versions,
in particular:

* `formatted string literals`_
  (aka *f-strings*)
  with :kbd:`=` specifiers

* `structural pattern matching`_

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _formatted string literals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings
.. _structural pattern matching: https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/


.. _ReshaprGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:UBC-MOAD/Reshapr.git

or copy the URI
(the stuff after :kbd:`git clone` above)
from the :guilabel:`Code` button on the `repository`_ page.

.. note::

    The :kbd:`git clone` command above assumes that your are `connecting to GitHub using SSH`_.
    If it fails,
    please follow the instructions in our :ref:`moaddocs:SecureRemoteAccess` docs to
    set up your SSH keys and :ref:`moaddocs:CopyYourPublicSshKeyToGitHub`.

    .. _connecting to GitHub using SSH: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


.. _ReshaprDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`reshapr-dev` that will have
all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd Reshapr
    $ conda env create -f envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate reshapr-dev

:py:obj:`Reshapr` is installed in `editable install mode`_ as part of the conda environment
creation process.
That means that the package is installed from the cloned repo via symlinks so that
it will be automatically updated as the repo evolves.

.. _editable install mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ conda deactivate


.. _ReshaprCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white
   :target: https://pre-commit.com
   :alt: pre-commit
.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :py:obj:`Reshapr` package uses Git pre-commit hooks managed by `pre-commit`_
to maintain consistent code style and and other aspects of code,
docs,
and repo QA.

.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/

To install the `pre-commit` hooks in a newly cloned repo,
activate the conda development environment,
and run :command:`pre-commit install`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd Reshapr
    $ conda activate reshapr-dev
    (reshapr-dev)$ pre-commit install

.. note::
    You only need to install the hooks once immediately after you make a new clone of the
    `Reshapr repository`_ and build your :ref:`ReshaprDevelopmentEnvironment`.

.. _Reshapr repository: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr


.. _ReshaprBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/reshapr/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://reshapr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :py:obj:`Reshapr` package is written in `reStructuredText`_
and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.
Creating a :ref:`ReshaprDevelopmentEnvironment` as described above includes the installation of Sphinx.
Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`reshapr-dev` development environment activated,
use:

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    Removing everything under '_build'...

    build succeeded.

    The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser
to preview the results of the build.
If you use Firefox,
you can probably accomplish that with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ firefox docs/_build/html/index.html

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built
and rendered at https://reshapr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _ReshaprLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr/actions/workflows/sphinx-linkcheck/badge.svg
    :target: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr/actions?query=workflow:sphinx-linkcheck
    :alt: Sphinx linkcheck

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find
broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`reshapr-dev)` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev))$ cd Reshapr/docs/
    (reshapr-dev)) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

You can monitor what lines of code the test suite exercises using the `coverage.py`_
and `pytest-cov`_ tools with the command:

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _pytest-cov: https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ cd Reshapr/
    (reshapr-dev)$ pytest --cov=./

and generate a test coverage report with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ coverage report

to produce a plain text report,
or

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ coverage html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening
:file:`Reshapr/htmlcov/index.html`.

Releases are done at Doug's discretion when significant pieces of development work have been
completed.

The release process steps are:

#. Use :command:`hatch version release` to bump the version from ``.devn`` to the next release
   version identifier;
   e.g. ``23.1.dev0`` to ``23.1``

#. Commit the version bump

#. Create an annotated tag for the release with :guilabel:`Git -> New Tag...` in PyCharm
   or :command:`git tag -e -a vyy.n`;
   :command:`git tag -e -a v23.1`

#. Push the version bump commit and tag to GitHub

#. Use the GitHub web interface to create a release,
   editing the auto-generated release notes as necessary

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to edit the release
   milestone:

   * Change the :guilabel:`Due date` to the release date
   * Delete the "when it's ready" comment in the :guilabel:`Description`

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to create a milestone for
   the next release:

   * Set the :guilabel:`Title` to the next release version,
     prepended with a ``v``;
     e.g. ``v23.2``
   * Set the :guilabel:`Due date` to the end of the year of the next release
   * Set the :guilabel:`Description` to something like
     ``v23.2 release - when it's ready :-)``
   * Create the next release milestone

#. Review the open issues,
   especially any that are associated with the milestone for the just released version,
   and update their milestone.

#. Close the milestone for the just released version.

#. Use :command:`hatch version minor,dev` to bump the version for the next development cycle,
   or use :command:`hatch version major,minor,dev` for a year rollover version bump

#. Commit the version bump

#. Push the version bump commit to GitHub
