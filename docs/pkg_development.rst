The Reshapr package (:py:obj:`Reshapr`) is Command-line tool based on Xarray and Dask
for extraction of model variable time series from model products like
SalishSeaCast, HRDPS & CANESM2/CGCM4.


.. _ReshaprPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.10/
    :alt: Python Version

The :py:obj:`Reshapr` package is developed and tested using `Python`_ 3.10.
The package uses some Python language features that are not available in various earlier versions,
in particular:

* `formatted string literals`_
  (aka *f-strings*)
  with :kbd:`=` specifiers

* `structural pattern matching`_

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _formatted string literals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings
.. _structural pattern matching: https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/

.. _ReshaprGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/Reshapr

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:UBC-MOAD/Reshapr.git

or copy the URI
(the stuff after :kbd:`git clone` above)
from the :guilabel:`Code` button on the `repository`_ page.

.. note::

    The :kbd:`git clone` command above assumes that your are `connecting to GitHub using SSH`_.
    If it fails,
    please follow the instructions in our :ref:`moaddocs:SecureRemoteAccess` docs to
    set up your SSH keys and :ref:`moaddocs:CopyYourPublicSshKeyToGitHub`.

    .. _connecting to GitHub using SSH: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


.. _ReshaprDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`reshapr-dev` that will have
all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd Reshapr
    $ conda env create -f envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate reshapr
    (reshapr-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable .

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` command above installs
the package from the cloned repo via symlinks so that the installed package will be
automatically updated as the repo evolves.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ conda deactivate


.. _ReshaprCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :py:obj:`Reshapr` package uses the `black`_ code formatting tool to maintain a
coding style that is very close to `PEP 8`_.

.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _PEP 8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

:command:`black` is installed as part of the :ref:`ReshaprDevelopmentEnvironment` setup.

To run :command:`black` on the entire code-base use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd Reshapr
    $ conda activate reshapr
    (reshapr-dev)$ black ./

in the repository root directory.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    **add example black output**


.. _ReshaprBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/reshapr/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://reshapr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :py:obj:`Reshapr` package is written in `reStructuredText`_
and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.
Creating a :ref:`ReshaprDevelopmentEnvironment` as described above includes the installation of Sphinx.
Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`reshapr-dev` development environment activated,
use:

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    Removing everything under '_build'...
    Running Sphinx v4.4.0
    making output directory... done
    loading intersphinx inventory from https://ubc-moad-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/objects.inv...

    copying extra files... done
    dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
    dumping object inventory... done
    build succeeded.

    The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser
to preview the results of the build.
If you use Firefox,
you can probably accomplish that with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ firefox docs/_build/html/index.html

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built
and rendered at https://reshapr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _ReshaprLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find
broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`reshapr-dev)` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev))$ cd Reshapr/docs/
    (reshapr-dev)) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    Running Sphinx v4.4.0
    making output directory... done
    loading pickled environment... done
    building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date
    building [linkcheck]: targets for 4 source files that are out of date

.. _ReshaprRunningTheUnitTests:

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :py:obj:`Reshapr` package is in :file:`Reshapr/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tool is used for test parametrization and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`reshapr-dev` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ cd Reshapr/
    (reshapr-dev)$ pytest

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

You can monitor what lines of code the test suite exercises using the `coverage.py`_
and `pytest-cov`_ tools with the command:

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _pytest-cov: https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ cd Reshapr/
    (reshapr-dev)$ pytest --cov=./

and generate a test coverage report with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ coverage report

to produce a plain text report,
or

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr-dev)$ coverage html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening
:file:`Reshapr/htmlcov/index.html`.
