***************************
:command:`info` Sub-command
***************************

The :command:`info` sub-command provides information about your installed version of ``Reshapr``
and the ``dask`` clusters and model profiles that are included with it.
Here is an example of the most basic level of output from :command:`reshapr info`:

.. code-block:: text

    reshapr, version 22.1.dev0
    xarray, version 0.21.1
    dask, version 2022.2.0
    netcdf4, version 1.5.8

    dask cluster configurations included in this package:
      salish_cluster.yaml

    model profiles included in this package:
      SalishSeaCast-201905.yaml
      SalishSeaCast-201812.yaml
      HRDPS-2.5km-GEMLAM-22sep11onward.yaml
      HRDPS-2.5km-GEMLAM-pre22sep11.yaml
      HRDPS-2.5km-operational.yaml

    Please use reshapr info --help to learn how to get deeper information,
    or reshapr --help to learn about other sub-commands.

:command:`reshaper info --help` will show you how you can get other information to help you
use ``Reshapr``:

.. code-block:: text

    Usage: reshapr info [OPTIONS] [CLUSTER_OR_MODEL]

      Provide information about the installed Reshapr package.

      With no cluster or model profile the following information is shown:

      * versions of reshapr, xarray, dask & netcdf4 packages

      * list of dask cluster configurations included in the package

      * list of model profiles included in the package

      Specify a dask cluster configuration (e.g. `reshapr info salish_cluster`) or
      a model profile (e.g. `reshpr info SalishSeaCast-201905`) to get information
      about them.

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.


:command:`info cluster`
=======================

:command:`reshaper info` followed by one of the dask cluster configurations shown in the
basic information list will show you the cluster settings.
Please see :ref:`ReshaprDaskClusterYAMLFile` for details about cluster configs.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reshapr)$ reshapr info salish_cluster.yaml

.. code-block:: text

    salish_cluster.yaml:
      # Configuration for a dask cluster on salish

      name: salish dask cluster
      processes: True
      number of workers: 4
      threads per worker: 4

    Please use reshapr info --help to learn how to get other information,
    or reshapr --help to learn about other sub-commands.
