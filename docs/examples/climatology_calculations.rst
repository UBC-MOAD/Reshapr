Calculation of Climatology Datasets
===================================

Reshapr can be used to calculate climatology datasets from month or day averaged datasets.
Here is an example extraction configuration YAML file to calculate the monthly climatology of
a collection of physics variables extracted from SalishSeaCast v202111 hindcast.

.. literalinclude:: monthly_physics_climatology.yaml
   :language: yaml

The name of the time coordinate in the resulting dataset is ``month``;
i.e. the value of the ``group by:`` item in the ``climatology:`` stanza.
At present,
the only values accepted for ``group by:`` are ``month`` and ``day``,
and monthly climatology calculation has been much more thoroughly tested than daily.

A ``selection:`` stanza can be used in conjunction with ``climatology:`` to calculate a climatology
dataset for a subset of the model domain.

``climatology:`` and ``resample:`` are mutually exclusive.
An error message will be printed if you try to do an extraction with both in the configuration.
