# List of dataset variables that are always dropped because they have no purpose
# in Reshapr operations.
# Dropping them when datasets are opened reduces the memory size of the dask tasks.
#
# Note that the `drop_variables` arg of xarray.open_mfdataset() is robust so that
# variables included in this list that do not appear in a dataset do not cause problems.


# NEMO generated variable that contains the same information as `time_counter`
- time_centered

# NEMO generated longitude and latitude fields that contain -1 values for land
# processor grid points when land processor elimination is used.
# If you want lon/lat fields in your dataset, use `include lons lats: True` in your
# processing configuration YAML file to get the fields from the source given by
# the dataset's `geo ref dataset` key.
