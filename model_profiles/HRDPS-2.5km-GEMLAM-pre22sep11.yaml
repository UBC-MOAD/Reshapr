# Reshapr model profile for ECCC HRDPS (High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System)
# 2.5 km resolution GEMLAM pre-operational model product fields processed for use as
# surface forcing fields for the SalishSeaCast models.
#
# This model profile is for the SalishSeaCast NEMO forcing files generated
# from the HRDPS model pre-operational period 2007-01-03 to 2011-09-21 product fields
# provided from archives maintained by the ECCC Vancouver office.
#
# For the HRDPS model product fields from the 2011-09-22 to 2014-11-18 pre-operational
# period please use the HRDPS-2.5km-GEMLAM-22sep11onward.yaml profile.
#
# For the HRDPS operational model product fields downloaded from the ECCC Datamart servers
# daily from 2014-09-12 to present please use the HRDPS-2.5km-operational.yaml profile.
