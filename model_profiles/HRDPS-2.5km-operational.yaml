# Reshapr model profile for ECCC HRDPS (High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System)
# 2.5 km resolution operational model product fields processed for use as
# surface forcing fields for the SalishSeaCast models
#
# This model profile is for the SalishSeaCast NEMO forcing files generated
# from the HRDPS model product fields downloaded from the ECCC Datamart servers
# daily from 2014-09-12 to present.
# For the HRDPS model product fields from the pre-operational periods please use:
#   2007-01-03 to 2011-09-21: the HRDPS-2.5km-GEMLAM-pre22sep11.yaml profile
#   2011-09-22 to 2014-11-18: the HRDPS-2.5km-GEMLAM-22sep11onward.yaml profile
